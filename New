Embedding a Looker dashboard on your organization's website and making it publicly accessible requires specific settings within Looker. To achieve this, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Access Looker Admin or Permissions**: You need to have appropriate permissions in Looker to make a dashboard publicly accessible. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to modify the dashboard's settings.

2. **Navigate to the Dashboard**: Go to the Looker dashboard you want to embed and make publicly accessible.

3. **Edit Dashboard Permissions**:
   - Click on the "Edit" option for the dashboard.
   - In the dashboard settings, navigate to the "Access" or "Permissions" section.

4. **Change Permissions**:
   - You may need to change the dashboard's permissions from private to public. To do this:
     - Remove any specific users or groups from the access list.
     - Add the "Everyone" or "Public" group to the access list with the appropriate permissions (usually 'View' access).

5. **Generate Embed Code**:
   - After making the dashboard public, you can generate the embed code.
   - Click on the "Share" or "Embed" option for the dashboard.
   - Customize the options for embedding, such as the layout, size, and any filters.
   - Copy the generated embed code.

6. **Embed on Your Website**:
   - Paste the copied embed code into the HTML code of your organization's website where you want the Looker dashboard to appear.

7. **Test**: Ensure the embedded dashboard works as expected on your website and is accessible to everyone.

Please note that making a dashboard public means that anyone with the embed code or the URL can access it. Be cautious about sharing sensitive or confidential data publicly, and ensure you are compliant with your organization's data security policies.

Always consult Looker's official documentation or seek guidance from your Looker admin if you encounter any specific issues or have further questions regarding embedding and permissions.
